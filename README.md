# Hello, there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Sathiyaraman M and I'm a Computer Science Engineering student. I'm from India, living in Chennai and currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering in RMK Engineering College, Tamil Nadu, India. 

I see myself as an ambitious, flamboyant, impulsive kid who is very much in love with .NET and spend most of my time doing projects with ASP.NET Core and Blazor, intending to be a Full-Stack Web Developer. Though I have worked with React and Angular, I just love building scalable and maintainable applications, exclusively and entirely using .NET.
